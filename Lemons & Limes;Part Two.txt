Said I am,
totally twisted, 
like these limes I just mixed it,
turning sour into sweet,
mixing lemons with the spritzer,
they don't get the bigger picture,
the memo they just missed it,
focused on the fucking bitches,
not the riches,
are y'all kidding?
I been hinting at the secret,
but I think that y'all just missed it,
Tim Cook just issued,
50,000 shares,
but for 50k a year they want me to act like I care,
put my feelings in the air,
stay present while I'm here,
just like a bottom feeder,
man they know they really need us,
cause this pyramid keep growing,
as y'all schememing and y'all schememing,
on the ones who actually putting in the work,
ain't getting no credit
they still causing all this hurt?
man fuck that I bust back,
and cock that shit,
take two shots when I'm off,
bitch I pop that clip,
man you think you gon control me?
been riding with my soul free,
most people they don't know me,
in my songs I expose lee,
so free,
so free,
bitch you get to know me,
ain't riding with no homies,
nah I wanna do this lonely,
don't really trust nobody,
ain't got love for nobody,
but I do go for the world only promises I can make,
do good to my girl only promises I can't break,
do good and I know,
that I'm always getting steady paid,
steady paid,
steady paid, 
you should do the same,
I been steady paid,
steady paid,
you should do the same,
you don't know me for no second,
I'm mixing Limes with the motherfucking Lemons,
spilting time that's obsession,
I'm getting mine living in the 4th dimension (yeah)
