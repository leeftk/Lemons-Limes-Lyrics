Said I am,
totally twisted, 
like these limes I just mixed it,
shifting sour into sweet,
spinning lemons with the spritzer,
they don't see the bigger picture,
so I'm the fixer

The memo they dismiss it,
resist it,
focused on the fucking bitches,
not the riches,
are y'all kidding?
I been hinting at the secret,
for you to elicit but y'all just miss it,
Tim Cook just issued,
50,000 shares,
and for 50k a year they want me to act like I care,
put my feelings in the air,
stay present while I'm snared, beware (adlib?: be aware)

(New Rhyme scheme)
Just like a feeder at the bottom,
the lowest soul in the 'cosm,
man, they know they really need us,
fear and mislead us,
********
this pyramid keeps growing,
as y'all scheming and scheming,
on the ones who actually put in the work,
ain't get no credit
they still cause all this hurt?
********

Man fuck that I bust back,
and cock that shit,
with two shots of buckshot,
bitch I pop that clip,
See, you think you gon' control me?
been riding with my soul free,
most people they don't know me,
in my songs I expose lee,
so free,
so free,
bitch you get to know me,
ain't riding with no homies, (adlib?: no we)
nah I'm gonna do this lonely,
don't really trust nobody,
(not sure what this next line is saying)
but I do go for the world only promises I can make,
do good to my girl only promises I can't break,
do good and I know,
that I'm always getting steady paid,
steady paid,
steady paid, 
you should do the same,
I been steady paid,
steady paid,
you should do the same,

(This is a dope hook)
I'm mixing Limes with the motherfucking Lemons,
spilting time; that's an obsession,
I'm getting mine in the 4th dimension (yeah)
you don't know me for no second,
I'm mixing Limes with the motherfucking Lemons,
spilting time; that's an obsession,
I'm getting mine in the 4th dimension (yeah)
